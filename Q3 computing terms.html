    <h1><h1 style="color:purple"><align><center> List of computing terms</center> </h1>
    <dl>
      <dt><b> 1. DATA</b>
      </dt>
      <dd>Data is Facts and figures which relay something specific, but which are not
        organized in any way and which provide no further information regarding
        patterns, context, etc. So data means "unstructured facts and figures that
        have the least impact on the typical manager. </dd>
      <dt><b>2. INFORMATION </b>
      </dt>
      <dd>For data to become information, it must be contextualized, categorized, calculated
        and condensed. Information thus paints a bigger picture; it is data with
        relevance and purpose. It may convey a trend in the environment, or perhaps
        indicate a pattern of sales for a given period of time. Essentially information
        is found "in answers to questions that begin with such words as who, what,
        where, when, and how many.</dd>
      <dt><b>3. WARMS </b>
      </dt>
      <dd>A worm is a small piece of software that uses computer networks and security
        holes to replicate itself. A copy of the worm scans the network for another
        machine that has a specific security hole. It copies itself to the new
        machine using the security hole, and then starts replicating from there,
        as well.
      </dd>
      <dt><b>4. VIRUSES</b>
      </dt>
      <dd> A virus is a small piece of software that piggybacks on real programs. For
        example, a virus might attach itself to a program such as a spreadsheet
        program. Each time the spreadsheet program runs, the virus runs, too, and
        it has the chance to reproduce (by attaching to other programs) or wreak
        havoc.
      </dd>
      <dt><b>5. TABLET COMPUTER </b>
        <dt>
          <dd>Like laptops, tablet computers are designed to be portable. However,
            they provide a very different computing experience. The most obvious
            difference is that tablet computers don't have keyboards or touchpads.
            Instead, the entire screen is touch-sensitive, allowing you to type
            on a virtual keyboard and use your finger as a mouse pointer. Tablet
            computers are mostly designed for consuming media, and they are optimized
            for tasks like web browsing, watching videos, reading e-books, and
            playing games. For many people, a "regular" computer like a desktop
            or laptop is still needed in order to use some programs. However, the
            convenience of a tablet computer means that it may be ideal as a second
            computer.
          </dd>
          <dt><b>6. STORAGE </b>
          </dt>
          <dd>Capability: Large volumes of data and information can be stored in the
            computer and also retrieved whenever required. A limited amount of
            data can be stored, temporarily, in the primary memory. Secondary storage
            devices like floppy disk and compact disk can store a large amount
            of data permanently</dd>
          <dt><b>7. SMARTPHON</b>
            <dt>
              <dd> A smartphone is a powerful mobile phone that is designed to run a
                variety of applications in addition to phone service. They are
                basically small tablet computers, and they can be used for web
                browsing, watching videos, reading e-books, playing games and more</dd>
              <dt><b>8. LAPTOP</b>
              </dt>
              <dd>A laptop is a battery or AC-powered personal computer that can be
                easily carried and used in a variety of locations. Many laptops
                are designed to have all of the functionality of a desktop computer,
                whichmeans they can generally run the same software and open the
                same types of files. However, some laptops, such as netbooks, sacrifice
                some functionality in order to be even more portable</dd>
              <dt><b>9. SOFTWARE </b>
                <dt>
                  <dd>Software is a generic term for organized collections of computer
                    data and instructions, often broken into two major categories:
                    system software that provides the basic nonï¿¾task-specific functions
                    of the computer, and application software which is used by
                    users to accomplish specific tasks</dd>
                  <dt><b>10. APPLICATIOION SOFTWARE</b>
                    <dt>
                      <dd> Application software is used to accomplish specific tasks
                        other than just running the computer system. Application
                        software may consist of a single program, such as an image
                        viewer; a small collection of programs (often called a
                        software package) that work closely together to accomplish
                        a task, such as a spreadsheet or text processing system;
                        a larger collection (often called a software suite) of
                        related but independent programs and packages that have
                        a common user interface or shared data format, such as
                        Microsoft Office, which consists of closely integrated
                        word processor, spreadsheet, database, etc.; or a software
                        system, such as a database management system, which is
                        a collection of fundamental programs that may provide some
                        service to a variety of other independent applications.
